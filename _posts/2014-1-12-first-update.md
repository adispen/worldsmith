title: First Update!
---

It's been a few days since I've announced Worldsmith, so I figure I would give an update on the progress.  

Custom Units are pretty much done, as they were very easy to add write editors for.  I want to go back and redo how Hero Overrides are handled (they are very badly done), but I'll do that after abilities.  Saving and Loading addons is also done, and I've used Worldsmith to edit some unit properties in Frostivus already.  

Abilities are rockin.  I have a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OfrXnCr.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="My caption">pretty cool screenshot </a> of the Behavior editor that Quintinity whipped up in like 2 hours.  It's pretty slick and it auto scales based on the number of options you have to select, which is very nice considering AbilityBehavior has 29 possible flags!

The last thing to do for Abilities and Items is to implement their triggers (OnCast, OnDamageTaken, etc).  This is kind of the biggest part and I'm already making good progress.

I've had some people ask how to best help out with the project.  Really, I don't need that much assistance outside of people that know WinForms really well and can help write editors.  Those that can contribute code, here is a link to the [project hosted on Github](https://github.com/RoyAwesome/WorldSmith).  If not and if Donating is your thing, I put up a [Donation Link](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=WF8XJ8SVQ9UAU&lc=US&item_name=Garrett%20Fleenor&item_number=Worldsmith&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted).  If neither of those things are what you can do, you could also just show this post (and others like it) to your friends.  I truly appreciate anyone who helps.  

I want to have a functioning data-only build by Steam DevDays, which is next week on Wednesday.  Luckily, I'm on the last stretch for Data.  After data is complete, I begin work on Maps.   Also, here is the album where I am putting all of [my screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/xGOwR#0).
