title: The road to release
---
It's been a month since I've started working on Worldsmith, and I'm nearing the first actual release of my unofficial Dota 2 editor.  



This release is going to be more of a preview of what is possible with Worldsmith, and while it will not let you create new custom maps, it will be a fully featured unit, item, ability, and hero editor.  

With this build, I mostly want to find out how people use Worldsmith and what pitfalls I can fix.  I also want to use the first release to find out where art is needed and to have an easy way to prioritize where icons are needed.

I've got some awesome screenshots of progress here:

I hope to have the first release Thursday or Friday next week.

Also, if you happen to be a halfway decent web developer and are interested in helping out, please send me an email.  This site kinda sucks and I'm bad at web development.
