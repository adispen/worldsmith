title: Development Update 2

---

Time for an update.  I was gone for a good chunk of this last week due to a small event called Steam Dev Days that I attended.  It was awesome and I got to talk to Robin Walker about quite a bit of stuff related to Dota and custom games.  I told him that I was working on Worldsmith and promised to try to do better than Valve's editor when they release it.  

After I got home from Dev Days, I deleted most of my progress on the New Action dialog and restarted it.  I really like the new approach I'm taking with it and it's easy to fill out a very Warcraft 3 like dialog for creating new actions for abilities.  If valve ever adds new data driven actions for abilities, I can add them to the editor very quickly, which is incredibly nice.

I do need help with a few things, however.  I need a 2d artist that can help make icons for Worldsmith, since some visual indication of what each button does will go a long way to making Worldsmith easy to use.  Also, I want to create a Worldsmith themed Dota loading screen and maybe a HUD to throw up on workshop to help advertise the editor and to make some money so I can get some real web hosting and have a place to put documentation when I get around to writing it.  If anyone can help with this, please PM me.

As always, if you can program in C#, I accept pull requests: https://github.com/RoyAwesome/WorldSmith .  If you are curious on helping, a way to handle Translations would be excellent and I'd appreciate that a ton.
