						<p>Without a few people, this project would be much much harder. In no particular order:</p>

						<ul>
						<li>penguinwizzard for figuring out how to write maps.</li>

						<li>tet, Sir_Kane, and hex6 for finding the strings for most of the flags and enums.</li>

						<li>hex6 for doing the legwork for setting up translations.</li>

						<li>Quintinity for cleaning up the quality and doing incredibly helpful quality work.</li>

						<li>OrangeSodaSmurf for providing a coupon for a free domain name and designing the new website.</li>
						</ul>
